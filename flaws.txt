# Potential Flaws and Technical Debt

This document identifies potential flaws, technical debt, and areas for improvement in the MKTA Tennis Academy system.

## Authentication and User Management

1. **Email Verification System**
   - The email verification functionality has been deprecated, but related code still exists
   - User accounts are now automatically verified (is_verified = True)
   - Technical debt: Need to remove verification_token and verification_token_expires fields from User model
   - This will require a database migration

2. **JWT Secret Key Management**
   - JWT implementation uses HS256 algorithm
   - The JWT_SECRET_KEY is loaded from environment variable with a fallback to a generated key
   - Risk: If the secret key changes between restarts, previously issued tokens will become invalid
   - Recommendation: Ensure stable JWT_SECRET_KEY in production environments

3. **Password Reset Implementation**
   - Password reset tokens are valid for 1 hour
   - The system sends a reset link via email but doesn't implement rate limiting
   - Risk: Potential for reset token brute-force attacks
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting on password reset requests

## Code Structure

1. **Duplicate Code**
   - The `save_upload_file` function was previously duplicated in multiple files
   - It has been refactored to be centralized in utils.py
   - Recommendation: Continue identifying and refactoring duplicate functionality

2. **Error Handling**
   - Error handling is inconsistent across different endpoints
   - Some errors are logged with detailed messages, others return generic responses
   - Recommendation: Standardize error handling and logging across all endpoints

## Database and Models

1. **Timestamp Management**
   - SQLAlchemy models with fields like `updated_at` automatically handle updates
   - Explicitly setting these fields in CRUD functions before committing is redundant
   - This has been fixed in crud_news.py but may exist in other CRUD modules
   - Recommendation: Review all CRUD functions for redundant timestamp updates

2. **Database Migrations**
   - Multiple migration scripts exist (migrations.py, migrations_email_verification.py, etc.)
   - No formal migration framework like Alembic is used
   - Risk: Difficult to track and manage database schema evolution
   - Recommendation: Implement a proper database migration system using Alembic

## Security

1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Current CORS policy allows all origins ("*")
   - While suitable for development, this is insecure for production
   - Recommendation: Restrict allowed origins to specific frontend URLs in production

2. **Input Validation**
   - Input validation relies primarily on Pydantic schemas
   - Some endpoints may lack sufficient validation, especially for file uploads
   - Recommendation: Implement additional validation for file uploads (size, content type)

3. **Authentication Checks**
   - The `get_current_user` dependency now checks if `user.is_active` is True
   - There's no role-based access control system implemented
   - Recommendation: Implement proper role-based access control for admin functions

## Performance

1. **File Storage System**
   - Files are stored directly on the filesystem rather than using a CDN or object storage
   - Risk: Scaling issues when deployed across multiple servers
   - Recommendation: Implement cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.) for static files

2. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Some endpoints fetch all records before filtering
   - Risk: Performance issues with large datasets
   - Recommendation: Review and optimize database queries, especially for listing endpoints

## Frontend Integration

1. **API Documentation**
   - While the API provides Swagger/OpenAPI documentation via /docs
   - There's no explicit documentation on how the frontend should integrate
   - Recommendation: Add frontend integration examples for common operations

## DevOps and Deployment

1. **Containerization**
   - The application uses Docker for development but doesn't have a production-ready Docker setup
   - Recommendation: Create proper Docker and docker-compose files for production deployment

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Environment variables are loaded directly, without validation
   - Risk: Missing or misconfigured environment variables can cause runtime issues
   - Recommendation: Implement environment variable validation on startup

3. **Testing**
   - Limited test coverage based on repository structure
   - Recommendation: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
